## Project Title: E-Commerce Backend

  ## Description:
  The idea of the project is to create a back-end to an psuedo E-commerce. In this project, users create a back end for any kind of e-commerce site. This project will allow users to add new data such as products, tags, and even categories. These can be used to help sort and also find products based on multiple factors like the product itself, products based on category and other minor details like price and stock. In doing so, the user will setup a server with the help of specific packages like Node and sequelize to build and modify a database. Insomonia is then used to test the different requests.
